# STM32F303K8-SPI_test
For testing only

IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM project.
Tested on STM32F303K8 Nucleo board

This is mostly for me to remember how to set up SPI master on the STM32F chipset. 
The code does not do anything by itself, but running it in debug mode with no optimalization 
it is possible so see the variable opdate if the configured SPI port is connected to a MAX6675
